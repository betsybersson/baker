\usage{
clean_perch_data(clean_options)
}
\arguments{
\item{clean_options}{The list of options for cleaning PERCH data.
Its elements are defined as follows:
\itemize{
\item{\code{RawMeasDir}}{: The file path to the raw data;}
\item{\code{case_def}}{: variable name in raw data for case definition;}
\item{\code{case_def_val}}{: The value for case definition;}
\item{\code{ctrl_def}}{: variable name in raw data for control definition;}
\item{\code{ctrl_def_val}}{: The value for control definition;}
\item{\code{X_strat}}{: A vector of variable names for stratifying the data
to perform SEPARATE analyses;}
\item{\code{X_strat_val}}{: A list of values for \code{X_strat}. The output
data will only correspond to those with \code{identical(X_strat,X_strat_val)==TRUE}.
To perform analysis on a single site, say \code{"02GAM"}, use \code{X_strat="newSITE"} and
\code{X_strat_val=list("02GAM")};}
\item{\code{pathogen_BrS_anyorder}}{: The vector of pathogen names (arbitrary
order) that have bronze-standard (BrS) measurments (cf. Wu et al. (2015) for
definitions and examplels of BrS, SS, and GS). It has to be a subset of
pathogens listed in taxonomy information at the file path \code{PathCatDir}.}
\item{\code{pathogen_SSonly}}{: A vector of pathogens that only have SS data;}
\item{\code{X_extra}}{: A vector of covariate names for regression
or visualization;}
\item{\code{X_order_obs}}{: A vector of variable names for ordering observations.
For example, it can include site names or enrollment dates. It must be a
subset of X_extra;}
\item{\code{write_newSite}}{: Must be set to \code{TRUE} if the raw data is
changed;}
\item{\code{newSite_write_Dir}}{: The file path to a cleaned data set after
combining subsites within a site;}
\item{\code{MeasDir}}{: The file path to the cleaned data set, usually the
same as \code{newSite_write_Dir};}
\item{\code{PathCatDir}}{: The file path to the pathogen category or taxonomy
information (.csv). The information should be as complete as possible to
display all pathogens considered in an actual study;}
\item{\code{allow_missing}}{: \code{TRUE} for using an observation that has
either BrS missing, or SS missing. Set it to \code{TRUE} if we want to use
the SS information from some cases who missed BrS measurements.
In other words, all the subjects' data will be used if \code{allow_missing} is
set to \code{TRUE}.}
}}
}
\value{
A List: \code{list(Mobs,Y,X,JSS,pathogen_BrS_ordered_by_MSS,pathogen_BrS_cat)}, or
with additional \code{JSSonly, pathogen_SSonly_cat} if silver-
standard only pathogens are supplied.
\itemize{
\item \code{Mobs} A list of bronze- (\code{MBS}), silver- (\code{MSS}),
and gold-standard (\code{MGS}, if available) measurements. Here if all
pathogens have BrS measures, MSS has the same number of columns as in MBS;
if some pathogens only have SS measures, then MSS will have extra columns;
\item \code{Y} 1 for case; 0 for control;
\item \code{X} Data frame of covariates for cases and controls. The covariate
names are specified in \code{X_extra};
\item \code{JSS} Number of pathogens having both silver- and bronze-standard
data;
\item \code{pathogen_BrS_ordered_by_MSS} Ordered vector of pathogen names. Pathogens
with both SS and BrS pathogens are ordered first and then those with only BrS
measurements. Note that for a pathogen name vector of arbitrary order
(\code{pathogen_BrS_anyorder}), this function just picks out those pathogens
with BrS+SS measures and puts them at the front. Other pathogens with only
BrS measures are not reordered. Pathogens with only silver-standard measures
are not included.
\item \code{pathogen_BrS_cat} Pathogen categories ordered according to
\code{pathogen_BrS_ordered_by_MSS}.
\item \code{JSSonly} Number of pathogens with only silver-standard measures;
\item \code{pathogen_SSonly_cat} Category of pathogens with only silver-standard
data.
}
This function does not re-order pathogens that only have silver-standard data.
}
\description{
\code{clean_perch_data} transforms a raw data table (row for subject, column
for variable - usually \code{\{pathogen name\}_\{specimen\}} and other covariate
names) into a list. It is specific for PERCH data format.
}
\details{
It deletes cases (\code{Y==1}) having two positives
for BCX measures. We suggest put \code{c("newSITE","ENRLDATE")} in
\code{X_extra} and \code{X_order_obs} to order cases and controls separately
according to site and enrollment date. In current implementation,
the raw data must have both BrS and SS measurements.
